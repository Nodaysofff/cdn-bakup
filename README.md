# cdn-bakup

This is key js files backup from cdns after a 5th of the may Jsdelivr failure.
I do not own any of those files and you should refer to licenses bundeled with those libraries in the corresponding folders.

This backup was made due to so some difficulties in using Jsdelivr and lack of full package bundles on cdnjs.cloudflare.
This backup was made primarily for website builder called Tilda, due to lack of options to host files directly when you use it in your projects over there
